# üóΩ Airbnb Listings EDA Project: New York 2024

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and host behavior. Tools used include **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.


---

## üéØ Objective

* Explore **room types, pricing, and availability** across neighborhoods
* Analyze **host behavior** and listing frequency
* Detect **price outliers**
* Offer actionable **recommendations** for both guests and hosts

---

## üìÇ Dataset Details

The dataset contains **20,765 records** with **22 features**, such as:

* `id`: Listing ID
* `name`: Listing title
* `host_name`: Host's name
* `neighborhood_group`: Borough name
* `latitude`, `longitude`: Geolocation
* `price`: Nightly cost
* `room_type`: Entire home, private or shared room
* `availability_365`: Days available in a year
* `reviews_per_month`: Monthly review average

---

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

* Handled nulls in `price`, `neighborhood`, and `beds`
* Converted `last_review` to **datetime**
* Capped extreme prices (>\$1,000) for better visualization

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis

* **Room Type Distribution**:

  * Bar plots show most listings are **Entire home/apt**
* **Neighborhood Group Insights**:

  * **Manhattan** has the **highest average price**
* **Availability Trends**:

  * Correlation heatmaps for features like `price`, `beds`, and `reviews`
* **Price Distribution**:

  * Histogram shows most listings between **\$50‚Äì\$300**
* **Host Listings**:

  * Boxplots highlight hosts with multiple properties
* **Review Behavior**:

  * Pair plots show link between reviews, availability, and price

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization Tools

* **Histograms**: Price distribution
* **Boxplots**: Outlier detection
* **Pair Plots**: Relationship insights
* **Heatmaps**: Correlation between numerical features
* **Bar Charts**: Room types and borough distributions

## üìä Key Insights

1. **Price Trends**

   * **Manhattan** is the most expensive borough
   * Entire homes command significantly higher prices

2. **Room Type Patterns**

   * Entire homes dominate, but **private rooms** offer more budget options

**For Hosts:**

* Increase **availability** and respond to reviews promptly
* Stay competitive with borough-specific pricing strategies
